This is the README file :)

it should contain the instructions for using the application below, perhaps the way it works as well.

there are a total of 7 function in this application for:

- "new": Creating new messages.
- "view": Undoing the addition.
- "removeLast": View the messages to prepare for sending.
- "send": Sends the messages to inbox.
- "inbox": View the sent messages.
- "clearInbox": Clear the entire inbox.
- "clearFirst": Clear the first message inside the inbox.
- "exit" is the option for exiting the application
